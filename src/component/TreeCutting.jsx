                      <p>Tree trimming or tree cutting is the process of maintaining control of those overgrown branches and foliage that interfere with the health of the tree or pose a risk to safety or property. Trimming is usually done annually or twice a year during the dormant season of the tree shrub or hedge. Sometimes people put off trimming trees because they think it will be exhausting work or that they might not end up with the look they wanted. JRs Tree Service is here to help.</p>
